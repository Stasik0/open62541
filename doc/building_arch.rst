Building for specific architectures
-----------------------------------

The open62541 library can be build for many operating systems and embedded systems.
This document shows a small excerpt of already tested architectures. Since the stack is only using the
C99 standard, there are many more supported architectures.

A full list of implemented architecture support can be found in the arch folder.

Windows, Linux, MacOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These architectures are supported by default and are automatically chosen by CMake.

Have a look into the previous sections on how to do that.

freeRTOS + LwIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
