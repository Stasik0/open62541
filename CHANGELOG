 * Empty arrays always match the array dimensions

   We consider empty arrays (also null-arrays) to have implied array
   dimensions [0,0,...]. So they always match the array dimensions
   defined in the variable. With this, the initialization of
   variables without a defined value has been simplified.
   We now create a null array if one is required.
